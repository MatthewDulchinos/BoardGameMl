# BoardGameMl

This project was a silly idea to pratice my data science skills.
The model makes predictions of a game's BoardGameGeek Rating based off of information like
the number of players it's best at, and whether it was kickstarted or not.

Currently the model has a terrible accuracy, topping out at mid 60s. This could be potentially
improved by using more information if found. Though to be honest, I think this would be a waste
to pursue seriously. Board game ratings would not make too much sense to be tied to certain
static traits like the minimum number of players who can play it.
